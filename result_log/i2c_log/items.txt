  - `busy` should be deasserted when `sto_condition` is detected.  

**VI-5**  
- **Description**: Verify that the `al` (arbitration lost) signal is asserted when the master drives `SDA` high, but the bus is low, or when a STOP condition is detected without being requested.  
- **Related Signals**: `al`, `sda_chk`, `sSDA`, `sda_oen`, `sto_condition`, `cmd_stop`.  
- **Condition**:  
  - `al` should be asserted when `sda_chk` is high, `sSDA` is low, and `sda_oen` is high.  
  - `al` should also be asserted when `sto_condition` is detected and `cmd_stop` is not set.  

**VI-6**  
- **Description**: Verify the correct operation of the state machine for START, STOP, READ, and WRITE commands.  
- **Related Signals**: `c_state`, `cmd`, `scl_oen`, `sda_oen`, `cmd_ack`.  
- **Condition**:  
  - Ensure the state transitions follow the expected sequence for each command.  
  - Verify that `cmd_ack` is asserted for one clock cycle at the end of each command.  

**VI-7**  
- **Description**: Verify that the `dout` signal correctly captures the value of `SDA` on the rising edge of `SCL`.  
- **Related Signals**: `dout`, `sSCL`, `dSCL`, `sSDA`.  
- **Condition**: `dout` should be updated with the value of `sSDA` when `sSCL` transitions from low to high.  

**VI-8**

- **Related Signals**: `scl_o`, `sda_o`.  
- **Condition**: Ensure `scl_o` and `sda_o` are always `1'b0`.

- **Description**: Verify that the `go` signal is asserted when any of the `start`, `stop`, `read`, or `write` commands are issued, and `cmd_ack` is low.  
- **Related Signals**: `go`, `start`, `stop`, `read`, `write`, `cmd_ack`.  
- **Condition**: `go` should be high when any of the commands (`start`, `stop`, `read`, `write`) are asserted, and `cmd_ack` is low.  

**VI-10**  
- **Description**: Verify that the `sr` (shift register) is loaded with the value of `din` when the `ld` signal is asserted.
