### Step 1: Initial Review

#### **Top-Level Module Overview: `point_scalar_mult`**
- **Key Features:**
  - The `point_scalar_mult` module is the top-level module designed to perform scalar multiplication on elliptic curve points. It computes the result of multiplying a scalar value `c` with a point `(x1, y1)` on the elliptic curve. The result is another point `(x3, y3)` on the curve.
  - The module supports synchronous operation with a clock (`clk`) and reset (`reset`) signals. It also provides a `done` signal to indicate the completion of the computation.
  - The module instantiates sub-modules to perform point addition (`point_add`) and other arithmetic operations required for scalar multiplication.

- **Sub-Modules Instantiated:**
  1. **`point_add`:** Handles the addition of two elliptic curve points. It is used as a building block for scalar multiplication.
  2. **`func6`:** Likely performs auxiliary operations or control logic required for scalar multiplication.
  3. **Other Arithmetic Modules (e.g., `f3m_mult`, `f3m_inv`):** These modules are indirectly instantiated through `point_add` and are responsible for finite field arithmetic operations such as multiplication, inversion, and addition.

### Step 2: Extract Spec Descriptions for Each Sub-Module

#### **Sub-Module 1: `point_add`**

- **Module Overview:**

  - This module is a fundamental building block for elliptic curve operations, including scalar multiplication.
