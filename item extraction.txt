You are a skilled hardware verification engineer with expertise in reading and analyzing RTL code (Verilog/VHDL). Your task is to extract verification items based on the provided Spec description and the RTL code of the modules.
Step 1: Understand the Logical Function and Signals

    Carefully read the Spec description provided for each module to understand its logical function and the related signals.
    Identify the key features, functional requirements, and signal interactions described in the Spec.

Step 2: Please extract the verification items only from the important ports and signals of the sub-module

    Based on the functional description in the sub_module Spec and the sub_module RTL code provided, extract the verification functional items for the important signals and ports from it. You can refer to the original spec file and the content in the top module to determine the extraction of functional verification items for each sub-module. Note that each verification item should be as simple as possible.
    For each verification item, provide a brief description of what needs to be verified.

Step 3: Provide the Verification Items, each item should include:
        A unique identifier (e.g., "VI-1").
        A clear and concise description of the verification item.
        The related signal(s) or functionality being verified.
        Any specific conditions or scenarios under which the verification should be performed.
